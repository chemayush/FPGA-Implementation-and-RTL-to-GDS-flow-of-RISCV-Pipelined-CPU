# FPGA-Implementation-of-Pipelined-RISCV-Cpu

# Overview
This project implements a 5-stage pipelined RISC-V CPU in Verilog, synthesized and tested on the PYNQ Z2 FPGA board. The CPU executes a custom Path Planning Algorithm that computes optimal routes on a predefined map. The algorithm is compiled to machine code, loaded into the CPU's instruction memory, and validated using FPGA hardware feedback (GREEN LED). This demonstrates a full-stack integration of hardware design, computer architecture, and algorithm deployment.
